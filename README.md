Project Challenges

One of the main challenges was maintaining consistent layout and navigation across multiple pages.
Because each page had its own HTML file, missing or incorrect imports (such as Bootstrap or Font Awesome) caused some pages to appear broken even though others worked correctly.

Another challenge was managing relative file paths between pages. Some links originally pointed to files that no longer existed, which caused navigation failures until the project was cleaned and rebuilt.

Browser caching was also an issue — GitHub Pages had deployed the fixed site, but old versions were still being shown until a hard refresh was used.
